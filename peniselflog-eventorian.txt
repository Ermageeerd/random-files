"I've discovered these strange creatures that
appear human, but strangely gain fur sometimes,
I don't know why yet though... I decided to use 
them in my world to study. I also styled my
Boyfriend clone to look more like them to see if 
they're friendly to their own kind, turns out: 
they are, kinda boring, but I'll accept it, I guess."
